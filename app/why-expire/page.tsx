      question: 'What are the hardest months to sell a house?',
      answer:
        'December and January are typically the hardest months to sell a house due to holidays, weather, and reduced buyer activity. However, proper strategy can overcome timing challenges. In Las Vegas, the market remains active year-round, but listings that expire during these months often do so because of poor marketing and pricing, not just timing. I have sold homes that did not sell during challenging months by using aggressive marketing, strategic pricing, and professional presentation. The key is not waiting for the "right" month - it is creating the right strategy regardless of timing. My 19-day average proves that with proper marketing, homes sell quickly even in challenging months. Learn more about why homes do not sell and how to fix them.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What decreases property value the most?',
      answer:
        'Poor presentation, overpricing, and weak marketing decrease property value perception more than the property itself. Dark photos, cluttered spaces, and unprofessional staging make homes look less valuable. Overpricing kills buyer interest immediately. Weak marketing makes homes invisible to qualified buyers. These factors are why homes do not sell - not the home itself. I fix these issues with professional photography ($3,700 investment), strategic pricing based on market data, and aggressive marketing (97-point system). This comprehensive approach is why I achieve 98.7% of asking price on homes that did not sell. The home itself is rarely the problem - it is how it is presented and marketed. See how I am different from your previous agent.',

                    If your home DID NOT sell, you are not alone. In fact, you are part of a significant trend in the Las Vegas real estate market. Understanding why homes fail to sell is the first step to fixing yours. The data is clear: most listings do not expire because of the home itself. They expire because of poor marketing, minimal investment, and zero follow-up from agents who do not know what they are doing.

                  After analyzing hundreds of HOMES THAT DID NOT SELL, I have identified five common failure patterns that cause listings to expire. Your previous agent likely made at least three of these mistakes. Understanding what went wrong is the first step to fixing it.

                      iPhone photos in 2026? Dark rooms, cluttered spaces, and unprofessional staging kill buyer interest in the first 2.3 seconds. Buyers scroll through hundreds of listings online. If your photos do not grab them immediately, they move on. Your previous agent spent $37 on photos. I spend $3,700 on professional media - twilight drone shots, 3D virtual tours, magazine-quality staging. The difference is obvious.
                    </p>

                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      Poor photography reduces buyer interest by 70-80%. Dark, cluttered photos make your home look smaller, less appealing, and less valuable. Professional photography increases showing requests by 300% and sale price by 5-10%. Your previous agent's $37 investment cost you thousands.

                      "Posted to MLS" is not a strategy. One open house, zero follow-up, no buyer targeting. Your house becomes invisible. Your previous agent posted your listing to MLS and disappeared. That's not marketing. That's laziness.
                    </p>

                      I use a 97-point marketing system that includes social media blitzes, network activation (500+ agents), targeted Facebook/Google ads, strategic open houses, and email marketing campaigns. Your previous agent did 3-5 points. I do 97. That's why I sell in 19 days and they got you expired.

                      Agents tell you what you want to hear to get the listing. Then suggest price drops every month. Amateur hour. Your previous agent probably told you your home was worth more than it actually was, just to get the listing. Then, when it DID NOT sell, they suggested price drops. That's not a strategy. That's incompetence.

                      Overpricing kills buyer interest immediately. Buyers are educated. They know market values. If your home is overpriced, they will not even look at it. I use data-driven pricing strategies based on market analysis, buyer psychology, and competitive positioning. I price it right from day one, so it sells fast at top dollar.

                      Your agent is juggling 47 other listings. You're inventory number #48. You get 2.1% of their attention. That's not enough to sell a home. Your previous agent spread themselves too thin, and your listing suffered.

                      Most agents operate on a volume-based model. They take as many listings as possible, invest minimal marketing in each, and hope something sticks. This model works for them - they collect commissions on the few that sell. But it does not work for you. You got minimal marketing, minimal attention, and a HOME THAT DID NOT SELL.

                  The longer your listing sits expired, the more it costs you. Every day you wait is another $116+ in holding costs. Every week is another $812. Every month is another $4,964. The cost of waiting is real. The cost of working with the wrong agent is real. The solution? Work with an agent who actually knows what they're doing.
