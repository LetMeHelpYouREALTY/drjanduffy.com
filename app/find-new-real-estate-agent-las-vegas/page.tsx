                You trusted an agent. They DIDN\'T deliver. Now what? Here's how
                to find a real estate agent who actually sells homes.
              </p>

              <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none mb-12">
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  You trusted an agent. They didn\'t deliver. Your listing
                  expired. Your home DIDN\'T sell. You're frustrated, angry, and
                  losing money every day. The average unsold home costs sellers
                  $4,964 per month in holding costs. That's $116 per day. Every
                  day you wait is money down the drain.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  But here's the truth: not all agents are created equal. Some
                  agents actually sell homes. Others just collect listings and
                  hope something sticks. You need to find an agent who actually
                  delivers results. I specialize in selling homes other agents
                  couldn\'t. 500+ families served. $127M+ in sales. 47 homes
                  that DIDN\'T sell with other agents - now sold. See{' '}

                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Your agent disappeared after listing your home. No weekly

                    Your home has been on the market for weeks with no showings.

                    doesn't know why. They don't care. This is a red flag. You
                    need an agent who actively markets your home and follows up
                    on every showing.

                    Your agent suggested price drop after price drop with no

                    This is a red flag. You need an agent who has a proven

                    I have a proven 30-day plan that sells homes. Week 1 is
                    aggressive reset. Week 2 is maximum exposure. Week 3 is
                    negotiation warfare. Week 4 is closing. Every week has
                    measurable outcomes. Every week moves you closer to SOLD.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Not all agents know all neighborhoods. You need an agent who
                  has sold homes in your specific neighborhood. I specialize in
                  Summerlin West: The Ridges, Red Rock Country Club, The Summit,
                  and newer villages. I know the market, the buyers, and what

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Ask about their marketing strategy. Generic answers like "I'll
                  market it" aren't enough. You need specific details:
                  professional photography, staging, social media, network
                  activation, targeted ads. I use a 97-point marketing system
                  with specific tactics for each step. This is what gets homes
                  sold.

                  Ask about communication. How often will you hear from them?
                  What format? Weekly reports? Real-time updates? I provide
                  weekly detailed reports with showing activity, buyer feedback,
                  market conditions, and strategy adjustments. Plus real-time
                  updates, direct phone access, email, and text. This

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Ask about photography and staging. Will they invest in
                  professional media? How much? I invest $3,700 in professional
                  media - twilight drone shots, 3D virtual tours,
                  magazine-quality staging. Professional photography increases
                  showing requests by 300% and sale price by 5-10%. This is what
                  gets homes sold.

                  Ask about pricing strategy. Will they use data-driven

                  pricing and market analysis to price your home right from day
                  one. I don't guess. I analyze. I price strategically to

                    Local expertise matters. I've sold multiple homes in The

                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    Speed matters. For homes that DIDN\'T sell with other
                    agents, I average 19 days to contract. For properly priced
                    and marketed homes, the average is 30-45 days. This is what
                    a proven system gets you.

                    Accountability matters. I have a proven system that works.

                    and adjust the strategy. I don't disappear. I don't make
                    excuses. I deliver results or we figure out why.

                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    Specific strategy matters. I use a 97-point marketing system
                    with specific tactics: professional photography ($3,700),
                    social media blitzes, network activation (500+ agents),
                    targeted ads, strategic open houses, email marketing. This
                    comprehensive system ensures your home gets maximum
                    exposure.

                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    Focus matters. I take maximum 6 listings at a time. You get
                    100% focus. Every home gets the full treatment. Your
                    previous agent had 47+ listings. You got 2.1% of their
                    attention. This focus is what separates successful sales
                    from failed listings.

                How to Choose a Real Estate Agent Who Actually Sells
              </h2>
              <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  Choosing the right agent is critical. Here's how to choose one
                  who actually sells:
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">
                  Look for Specialization
                </h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Not all agents are good at everything. Some specialize in
                  first-time buyers. Some specialize in luxury homes. Some
                  specialize in homes that DIDN\'T sell. I specialize in homes
                  that didn\'t sell with other agents. This specialization is
                  what delivers results. 47 homes That Didn\'t sell - now sold.
                  19 day average. 98.7% of asking price.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">
                  Check Their Track Record
                </h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Ask for specific results. How many homes sold? Average days on
                  market? Average sale price percentage? I've sold 47 homes that
                  DIDN\'T sell with other agents. Average 19 days to contract.
                  98.7% of asking price. $127M+ in total sales. 500+ families
                  served. These are real results, not promises.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">
                  Ask About Their System
                </h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Results come from systems, not luck. Ask about their process.
                  What happens week by week? What's the marketing strategy?
                  What's the follow-up system? I have a proven 30-day plan with
                  specific tactics for each week. This system is what delivers
                  results.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">
                  Verify Their Investment
                </h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Ask about their marketing investment. How much do they spend
                  per listing? What do they spend it on? I invest $5,000+ per
                  listing: $3,700 on professional media, plus marketing,
                  staging, and follow-up. This investment is what gets homes
                  sold. Your previous agent spent $100. That's why your home
                  DIDN\'T sell.

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">
                  Read Testimonials
                </h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Read testimonials from real clients. Do they mention specific
                  results? Communication? Marketing? I have testimonials from 47
                  sellers who couldn\'t sell with their previous agent. They
                  mention specific results, communication, and marketing. See{' '}
