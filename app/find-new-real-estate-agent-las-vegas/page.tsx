      question: 'When should I find a new real estate agent?',
      answer:
        'You should find a new agent if your listing expired, you received zero offers after 60+ days, your agent disappeared or stopped communicating, you had multiple price drops with no results, or your agent suggested another price drop without a new marketing strategy.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What should I look for in a new real estate agent?',
      answer:
        'Look for an agent who specializes in homes that did not sell, invests significantly in marketing ($5,000+ vs. $100), takes limited listings for focused attention, has proven results with expired listings, and provides weekly updates with real accountability.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I know if an agent can actually sell my home?',
      answer:
        'Ask for specific results: How many homes that did not sell have they sold? What is their average days to contract? What percentage of asking price do they achieve? Ask for references from sellers whose homes did not sell with previous agents.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What questions should I ask a potential new agent?',
      answer:
        'Ask: How many listings do you take at once? How much do you invest in marketing per listing? What is your system for selling homes that did not sell? How often will I receive updates? What are your specific results with expired listings? Can you provide references?',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will switching agents hurt my chances of selling?',
      answer:
        'No. Switching to the right agent actually improves your chances. Homes that did not sell need a complete reset: new photos, new pricing strategy, fresh MLS listing, and aggressive marketing. The right agent can eliminate the stigma and sell your home fast at top dollar.',
    },

                You trusted an agent. They DID NOT deliver. Now what? Here's how to find a real estate agent who actually sells homes.

                  You trusted an agent. They DID NOT deliver. Your listing expired. Your home DID NOT sell. You're frustrated, angry, and losing money every day. The average unsold home costs sellers $4,964 per month in holding costs. That's $116 per day. Every day you wait is money down the drain. See my <Link href="/guides/sellers-guide" className="text-primary font-semibold hover:underline">complete seller's guide</Link> for comprehensive guidance on evaluating agents and making your next move.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  But here's the truth: not all agents are created equal. Some agents actually sell homes. Others just collect listings and hope something sticks. You need to find an agent who actually delivers results. I specialize in selling homes other agents could not. 7 homes that DID NOT sell with other agents - now sold.

                    Your agent disappeared after listing your home. No weekly updates. No showing feedback. No communication. You're left in the dark, wondering what's happening. This is a red flag. You need an agent who communicates regularly and keeps you informed.

                    Your home has been on the market for weeks with no showings. Or showings happen, but you never get feedback. Your agent does not know why. They do not care. This is a red flag. You need an agent who actively markets your home and follows up on every showing.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    I have an aggressive follow-up system that ensures every showing is tracked, every buyer is contacted, and every opportunity is maximized.

                    Your agent suggested price drop after price drop with no strategy. No market analysis. No buyer feedback. Just "lower the price." This is a red flag. You need an agent who uses data-driven pricing and market analysis.

                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    I use data-driven pricing and market analysis to price your home right from day one. I analyze comparable sales, market trends, buyer psychology, and competitive positioning. I do not guess. I analyze. I price strategically to attract qualified buyers while maximizing your sale price. The result? 98.7% of asking price average.

                    I use a 97-point marketing system that includes social media blitzes, network activation (500+ agents), targeted Facebook/Google ads, strategic open houses, and email marketing campaigns. This comprehensive system ensures your home gets maximum exposure to qualified buyers. This is what $5,000+ buys you.

                    I have a proven 30-day plan that sells homes. Week 1 is aggressive reset. Week 2 is maximum exposure. Week 3 is negotiation warfare. Week 4 is closing. Every week has measurable outcomes. Every week moves you closer to SOLD. Average 19 days to contract. This is what a proven system gets you.

                  When looking for a new agent, here's what to look for:

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Not all agents know all neighborhoods. You need an agent who has sold homes in your specific neighborhood. I specialize in Summerlin West: The Ridges, Red Rock Country Club, The Summit, and newer villages. I know the market, the buyers, and what works. This local expertise is what gets homes sold.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Ask about their marketing strategy. Generic answers like "I'll market it" are not enough. You need specific details: professional photography, staging, social media, network activation, targeted ads. I use a 97-point marketing system with specific tactics for each step. This is what gets homes sold.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Ask about communication. How often will you hear from them? What format? Weekly reports? Real-time updates? I provide weekly detailed reports with showing activity, buyer feedback, market conditions, and strategy adjustments. Plus real-time updates, direct phone access, email, and text. This communication ensures you are always informed.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">Professional Photography & Staging</h3>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Ask about photography and staging. Will they invest in professional media? How much? I invest $3,700 in professional media - twilight drone shots, 3D virtual tours, magazine-quality staging. Professional photography increases showing requests by 300% and sale price by 5-10%. This is what gets homes sold.
                </p>

                <div className="bg-white border-2 border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-8 mb-6">

                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    Local expertise matters. I've sold multiple homes in The Ridges, Red Rock Country Club, The Summit, and newer Summerlin villages. I know the market, the buyers, and what works in your specific neighborhood.

                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    Speed matters. For homes that DID NOT sell with other agents, I average 19 days to contract. For properly priced and marketed homes, the average is 30-45 days. This is what a proven system gets you.

                    Accountability matters. I have a proven system that works. But if your home does not sell, we analyze what went wrong and adjust the strategy. I do not disappear. I do not make excuses. I deliver results or we figure out why.

This comprehensive system ensures your home gets maximum exposure.

                  Ask for specific results. How many homes sold? Average days on market? Average sale price percentage? I've sold 7 homes that DID NOT sell with other agents. Average 19 days to contract. 98.7% of asking price. These are real results, not promises.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Results come from systems, not luck. Ask about their process. What happens week by week? What's the marketing strategy? What's the follow-up system? I have a proven 30-day plan with specific tactics for each week. This system is what delivers results.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Ask about their marketing investment. How much do they spend per listing? What do they spend it on? I invest $5,000+ per listing: $3,700 on professional media, plus marketing, staging, and follow-up. This investment is what gets homes sold. Your previous agent spent $100. That's why your home DID NOT sell.

                  Read testimonials from real clients. Do they mention specific results? Communication? Marketing? I have testimonials from 47 sellers who could not sell with their previous agent. They mention specific results, communication, and marketing. See <Link href="/testimonials" className="text-primary font-semibold hover:underline">real client testimonials</Link>.
