                  Looking for a Summerlin real estate agent? You need someone
                  who knows the market, understands luxury buyers, and has
                  proven results. I specialize in Summerlin West luxury homes:

                  Whether you're buying or selling in Summerlin, you need an
                  agent who understands the unique dynamics of this luxury
                  market. Price ranges from $800K to $10M+. Buyer demographics
                  are different. Marketing needs are different. Negotiation
                  strategies are different. This is why you need a Summerlin
                  specialist, not just any Las Vegas agent.

                      Summerlin prices have stabilized after 2023-2024
                      adjustments. Luxury segment ($2M+) remains strong with

                      with good buyer activity.
