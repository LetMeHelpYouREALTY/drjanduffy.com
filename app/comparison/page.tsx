        'Dr. Jan Duffy invests $5,000+ per listing in marketing (vs. $100 average), takes maximum 6 listings for 100% focus (vs. 47+ listings with 2.1% focus), uses a 97-point marketing system (vs. "post to MLS"), and provides weekly updates with real accountability. She specializes exclusively in Las Vegas homes that did not sell.',

She serves Summerlin, Henderson, and surrounding areas with aggressive marketing that sells homes in 19 days average.',

      question: 'How many listings does Dr. Jan Duffy take in Las Vegas?',
      answer:
        'Dr. Jan Duffy takes maximum 6 listings at a time, ensuring 100% focus on each Las Vegas home. Most agents juggle 47+ listings, giving you only 2.1% of their attention. With Dr. Jan Duffy, you get dedicated service for your Summerlin, Henderson, or Las Vegas home.',

      question: 'What results can I expect with Dr. Jan Duffy vs. other Las Vegas agents?',

Dr. Jan Duffy gets you 98.7% of asking price and closes in 19 days average. That\'s $15K-$40K MORE than cash buyers in similar timeframes. The only time cash buyers make sense is if you need to close in 7 days or less.',

Dr. Jan Duffy gets you 98.7% of asking price (average) and closes in 19 days. You get $15K-$40K MORE than cash buyers while still closing fast. She serves Las Vegas, Summerlin, and Henderson.',

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  I invest more because I bring buyers. Professional photography increases showing requests by 300% and sale price by 5-10%. Strategic marketing brings qualified buyers who are ready to make offers. Aggressive follow-up converts interest into offers. The $5,000+ investment pays for itself by bringing buyers who pay top dollar and close fast.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  The $5,000+ investment is not a cost - it's an investment in bringing buyers. Professional photography showcases your home at its best, attracting more buyers and commanding higher prices. Strategic marketing reaches qualified buyers who are ready to purchase. Aggressive follow-up ensures every showing leads to an offer. The investment pays for itself by bringing buyers who pay top dollar. Your previous agent saw it as a cost and minimized it. I see it as an investment in bringing buyers and maximize it.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Your previous agent invested less because they were juggling 47 other listings. They could not afford to invest $5,000+ in every listing. So they invested $100, hoped for the best, and got you expired. That's not how you sell homes. That's how you fail.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                  Your previous agent's business model was volume-based. They took as many listings as possible, invested minimal marketing in each, and hoped something would stick. This model works for them - they collect commissions on the few that sell. But it does not work for you. You got minimal marketing, minimal attention, and a HOME THAT DID NOT SELL. That's the cost of working with a volume-based agent. That's why your home DID NOT sell.

                    <strong>Cash buyers like Opendoor and HomeLight</strong> offer speed but cost you $30,000-$60,000+ on a $400,000 home. They pay 70-85% of market value, charge 5-12% service fees, and make heavy deductions for repairs.

                    <strong>Dr. Jan Duffy's approach</strong> gets you 98.7% of asking price (average) and closes in 19 days. That's $15,000-$40,000 MORE than cash buyers, in similar timeframes. You get top dollar AND fast closing.

                    The only time cash buyers make sense: if you need to close in 7 days or less. Otherwise, my proven system gets you more money in similar timeframes.

                  Let's break down each category to understand exactly what your previous agent did vs. what I do:

                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Your previous agent used iPhone photos. They spent $37 on photos, took a few quick shots, and called it done. The photos were dark, poorly lit, and DID NOT showcase your home's best features. Buyers saw these photos and scrolled past. Your home became invisible in a sea of listings.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      I invest $3,700 in professional media. Professional photography showcases your home at its best. Twilight drone shots capture your property at golden hour. 3D virtual tours allow buyers to tour 24/7. Magazine-quality staging makes your home look like it belongs in a design magazine. Every photo is professionally edited. Every room is staged to perfection. This professional media is what attracts buyers and commands higher prices. This is what $3,700 buys you. This is what your previous agent DID NOT provide.

                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Your previous agent used a "post to MLS and pray" strategy. They posted your listing to MLS, held maybe one open house, and disappeared. That's not marketing. That's negligence. Your home got minimal exposure, attracted few buyers, and expired.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      I use a 97-point marketing system that leaves nothing to chance. Social media marketing blitz reaches thousands of potential buyers. Network activation reaches 500+ agents who can bring qualified buyers. Targeted Facebook and Google ads reach buyers actively searching for homes. Strategic open houses with buyer pre-qualification attract serious buyers. Email marketing campaigns reach qualified buyers in your price range. This comprehensive system ensures your home gets maximum exposure to qualified buyers. This is what $5,000+ buys you. This is what your previous agent DID NOT provide.

                    <HeadingMedia level={3} heading="Follow-Up: Zero vs. Aggressive" />
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Your previous agent had zero follow-up. Buyers saw your home, but your agent never followed up. Feedback disappeared. Opportunities were lost. Showings happened, but nothing came of them. Your agent DID NOT know why. They did not care. They moved on to the next listing.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      I have an aggressive follow-up system that ensures every showing is tracked, every buyer is contacted, and every opportunity is maximized. I follow up within 2 hours of every showing. I collect feedback from every buyer. I create urgency through buyer psychology tactics. I do not wait for offers. I create them. I do not accept lowball offers. I negotiate them up. This aggressive follow-up is what turns showings into offers and offers into sales. This is how I get 98.7% of asking price average. This is how your previous agent got you expired.

                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Your previous agent had 47+ listings. You got 2.1% of their attention. They could not afford to invest $5,000+ in every listing. They could not provide aggressive follow-up on every showing. They could not manage every detail. They spread themselves thin, hoping something would stick. Your listing got lost in the shuffle.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      I take maximum 6 listings at a time. You get 100% focus. Every listing gets the full treatment - professional marketing, aggressive follow-up, strategic negotiation. Nothing is left to chance. This focus is what separates successful sales from homes that DID NOT sell. This focus is what delivers results. This is what your previous agent DID NOT provide.

                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Your previous agent got you expired. 63 days on market. 37 showings. 5 price drops. Zero offers. Then your home did not sell, and they made $0 while you lost $4,964 per month in holding costs. That's the result of minimal marketing, zero follow-up, and 2.1% attention.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      I get you sold. 19 day average to contract. 98.7% of asking price. SOLD. That's the result of $5,000+ investment, aggressive follow-up, and 100% focus. The difference is not subtle. It's dramatic. And it's why I sell homes that DID NOT sell while they got you expired.
