                  But the difference in results is even more dramatic: expired
                  vs. sold, $0 commission vs. full commission, $4,964/month loss
                  vs. top dollar sale.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Why I Invest More</h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  I invest more because I know it works. Professional
                  photography increases showing requests by 300% and sale price
                  by 5-10%. Strategic marketing brings qualified buyers.
                  Aggressive follow-up creates urgency. The $5,000+ investment
                  pays for itself through faster sales and higher prices.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  The $5,000+ investment isn't a cost - it's an investment in
                  your success. Professional photography showcases your home at
                  its best, attracting more buyers and commanding higher prices.
                  Strategic marketing reaches qualified buyers who are ready to
                  purchase. Aggressive follow-up ensures every showing leads to
                  an offer. The investment pays for itself through faster sales
                  and higher prices. Your previous agent saw it as a cost and
                  minimized it. I see it as an investment and maximize it.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">
                  Why Your Agent Invested Less
                </h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Your previous agent invested less because they were juggling
                  47 other listings. They couldn\'t afford to invest $5,000+ in
                  every listing. So they invested $100, hoped for the best, and
                  got you expired. That's not how you sell homes. That's how you
                  fail.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                  Your previous agent's business model was volume-based. They
                  took as many listings as possible, invested minimal marketing
                  in each, and hoped something would stick. This model works for
                  them - they collect commissions on the few that sell. But it
                  doesn't work for you. You got minimal marketing, minimal
                  attention, and an HOME THAT DIDN\'T SELL. That's the cost of
                  working with a volume-based agent. That's why your home
                  DIDN\'T sell.

                  Let's break down each category to understand exactly what your
                  previous agent did vs. what I do:

                      Photography: iPhone vs. Professional
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Your previous agent used iPhone photos. They spent $37 on
                      photos, took a few quick shots, and called it done. The
                      photos were dark, poorly lit, and didn\'t showcase your
                      home's best features. Buyers saw these photos and scrolled
                      past. Your home became invisible in a sea of listings.

                      I invest $3,700 in professional media. Professional
                      photography showcases your home at its best. Twilight
                      drone shots capture your property at golden hour. 3D
                      virtual tours allow buyers to tour 24/7. Magazine-quality
                      staging makes your home look like it belongs in a design
                      magazine. Every photo is professionally edited. Every room
                      is staged to perfection. This professional media is what
                      attracts buyers and commands higher prices. This is what
                      $3,700 buys you. This is what your previous agent DIDN\'T
                      provide.

                      Marketing: Post and Pray vs. 97-Point System
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Your previous agent used a "post to MLS and pray"
                      strategy. They posted your listing to MLS, held maybe one
                      open house, and disappeared. That's not marketing. That's
                      negligence. Your home got minimal exposure, attracted few
                      buyers, and expired.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      I use a 97-point marketing system that leaves nothing to
                      chance. Social media marketing blitz reaches thousands of
                      potential buyers. Network activation reaches 500+ agents
                      who can bring qualified buyers. Targeted Facebook and
                      Google ads reach buyers actively searching for homes.
                      Strategic open houses with buyer pre-qualification attract
                      serious buyers. Email marketing campaigns reach qualified
                      buyers in your price range. This comprehensive system
                      ensures your home gets maximum exposure to qualified
                      buyers. This is what $5,000+ buys you. This is what your
                      previous agent DIDN\'T provide.

                      Follow-Up: Zero vs. Aggressive
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Your previous agent had zero follow-up. Buyers saw your
                      home, but your agent never followed up. Feedback
                      disappeared. Opportunities were lost. Showings happened,
                      but nothing came of them. Your agent didn\'t know why.
                      They didn't care. They moved on to the next listing.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      I have an aggressive follow-up system that ensures every
                      showing is tracked, every buyer is contacted, and every
                      opportunity is maximized. I follow up within 2 hours of
                      every showing. I collect feedback from every buyer. I
                      create urgency through buyer psychology tactics. I don't
                      wait for offers. I create them. I don't accept lowball
                      offers. I negotiate them up. This aggressive follow-up is
                      what turns showings into offers and offers into sales.
                      This is how I get 98.7% of asking price average. This is
                      how your previous agent got you expired.

                      Attention: 2.1% vs. 100%

                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Your previous agent had 47+ listings. You got 2.1% of
                      their attention. They couldn\'t afford to invest $5,000+
                      in every listing. They couldn't provide aggressive
                      follow-up on every showing. They couldn't manage every
                      detail. They spread themselves thin, hoping something
                      would stick. Your listing got lost in the shuffle.

                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      I take maximum 6 listings at a time. You get 100% focus.
                      Every listing gets the full treatment - professional
                      marketing, aggressive follow-up, strategic negotiation.
                      Nothing is left to chance. This focus is what separates
                      successful sales from homes that DIDN\'T sell. This focus
                      is what delivers results. This is what your previous agent
                      didn\'t provide.

                      Results: Expired vs. Sold
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Your previous agent got you expired. 63 days on market. 37
                      showings. 5 price drops. Zero offers. Then your home
                      didn't sell, and they made $0 while you lost $4,964 per
                      month in holding costs. That's the result of minimal
                      marketing, zero follow-up, and 2.1% attention.

                      I get you sold. 19 day average to contract. 98.7% of

                      investment, aggressive follow-up, and 100% focus. The
                      difference isn't subtle. It's dramatic. And it's why I
                      sell homes that DIDN\'T sell while they got you expired.
