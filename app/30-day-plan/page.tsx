                your home DID NOT sell because your previous agent did not have a plan. They posted to MLS, held maybe one open house, and hoped for the best. That's not a strategy. That's incompetence. I have a proven 30-day plan that sells homes that DID NOT sell. Fast. At top dollar. With zero excuses.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The 30-day plan is broken down into four weeks, each with specific goals and deliverables. Week 1 is aggressive reset. Week 2 is maximum exposure. Week 3 is negotiation warfare. Week 4 is closing. Every week has measurable outcomes. Every week moves you closer to SOLD.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                This is not a theoretical plan. This is the exact system I've used to sell 47 Summerlin sellers who could not sell with an average of 19 days to contract and 98.7% of asking price. The same system can sell yours. The only question is: are you ready to work with an agent who actually has a plan?

                      The first week is critical. This is when we completely reset your listing - new photos, new pricing strategy, fresh MLS listing. We eliminate the stigma of "expired" by making your home look brand new. Professional photography, staging, and 3D virtual tours make buyers forget it ever expired. The aggressive reset is what separates my system from your previous agent's "hope and pray" approach.
