    {
      question: 'Why did my listing expire?',
      answer:
        "Most homes fail to sell due to poor marketing, overpricing, or lack of follow-up. Your previous agent likely used minimal marketing (just MLS posting), didn't invest in professional photography, and failed to aggressively follow up on showings. I fix all of these issues.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long will it take to sell my HOME THAT DIDN'T SELL?",
      answer:
        "My average is 19 days from listing to contract. Most HOMES THAT DIDN'T SELL sell within 2-4 weeks when properly marketed and priced. I continue working until your home sells.",
    },
    {
      question: 'What percentage of asking price can I expect?',
      answer:
        "I average 98.7% of asking price on HOMES THAT DIDN'T SELL. This is significantly higher than the market average because of my aggressive marketing and negotiation strategies.",
    },
    {
      question: 'What makes you different from my previous agent?',
      answer:
        'I invest $5,000+ in marketing per listing (vs. $100 average), take maximum 6 listings at a time (vs. 47+), use a 97-point marketing system (vs. "post to MLS"), and provide weekly updates with real accountability.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you work with luxury homes?',
      answer:
        "Yes. I specialize in luxury properties in The Ridges, Red Rock CC, The Summit, and Summerlin West. I've sold expired luxury listings ranging from $675K to $2.1M.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if my home doesn't sell in 30 days?",
      answer:
        "I continue working at no additional cost until it sells. You don't pay extra commission - I work until your home is sold.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How much do you charge?',
      answer:
        'Standard commission rates apply. However, I invest significantly more in marketing ($5,000+ vs. industry average of $100), which typically results in faster sales and higher prices.',
    },
    {
      question: "Can you sell my home if it's been expired for months?",
      answer:
        "Yes. I've sold homes that were expired for 200+ days. The key is a complete reset: new photos, new pricing strategy, fresh MLS listing, and aggressive marketing. Stigma can be overcome with the right approach.",
    },
    {
      question: 'What neighborhoods do you serve?',
      answer:
        'I specialize in Summerlin West, The Ridges, Red Rock Country Club, The Summit, and surrounding Las Vegas luxury communities.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How quickly can you start?',
      answer:
        'I can begin the reset process within 24-48 hours. Professional photography and staging typically happen within 3-5 days, with the fresh listing going live within a week.',

                  Most agents avoid answering tough questions. They give vague
                  answers, make promises, and hope you don't ask follow-ups. I
                  answer every question directly, honestly, and with real data.

                  Common Concerns About HOMES THAT DIDN\'T SELL

                      Is My Home Stigmatized?
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Many sellers worry that their HOME THAT didn\'t SELL is
                      stigmatized - that buyers will see "expired" and think
                      "what's wrong with it?" The truth is, HOMES THAT DIDN\'T
                      SELL can be stigmatized, but the stigma can be overcome.
                      The key is a complete reset: new photos, new pricing
                      strategy, fresh MLS listing, and aggressive marketing.
                      When buyers see a beautiful, properly priced home with
                      professional marketing, they forget it ever expired.

                      How I Overcome Stigma
                    </h4>
                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      I overcome stigma through aggressive reset. Professional
                      photography makes your home look brand new. Fresh MLS
                      listing eliminates the "expired" label. Strategic pricing
                      positions your home competitively. Aggressive marketing
                      brings qualified buyers. The stigma disappears when buyers
                      see a beautiful, properly priced home with professional
                      marketing.

                      Will I Get Less Than Asking?
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Many sellers worry that HOMES THAT didn\'t SELL sell for
                      less than asking. The truth is, it depends on the agent.
                      Your previous agent probably got you expired because they
                      overpriced your home or didn't negotiate effectively. I
                      average 98.7% of asking price on HOMES THAT DIDN\'T SELL
                      through aggressive marketing and strategic negotiation.

                      I get top dollar through data-driven pricing, aggressive
                      marketing, and strategic negotiation. I price your home
                      right from day one, so it sells fast at top dollar. I use
                      buyer psychology tactics and strategic counter-offers to
                      maximize your sale price. I don't accept lowball offers. I
                      negotiate them up.

                      How Long Will It Really Take?
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Many sellers worry that HOMES THAT didn\'t SELL take
                      longer to sell. The truth is, it depends on the agent.
                      Your previous agent probably got you expired because they
                      DIDN\'T have a system. I have a proven 30-day plan that
                      sells homes that didn't sell. I average 19 days to
                      contract and continue working until your home sells.

                    <p className="text-gray-700">
                      I sell fast through aggressive reset, maximum exposure,
                      and strategic negotiation. Week 1 is aggressive reset.
                      Week 2 is maximum exposure. Week 3 is negotiation warfare.
                      Week 4 is closing. Every week has measurable outcomes.
                      Every week moves you closer to SOLD.
