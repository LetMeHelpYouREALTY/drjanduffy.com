                  Las Vegas townhomes offer space, value, and community living in a single-family home alternative. If your townhome home DID NOT sell, you're not alone. Townhomes face unique challenges - from competition with single-family homes to HOA restrictions to buyers who value space and affordability. Most agents do not understand townhomes. They use generic strategies, and townhomes expire.
