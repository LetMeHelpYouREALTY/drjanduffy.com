                  Las Vegas high-rise condos are luxury properties that require sophisticated marketing. They compete with world-class resorts. They attract high-end buyers.

                  High-rise condos expire for the same reasons other condos expire - poor marketing, minimal investment, and zero follow-up. But high-rise condos face additional challenges that most agents do not understand or address.

                  High-rise condos have strict building restrictions. Limited open houses. Restricted photography. Complex approval processes.
