                  The Cosmopolitan is a luxury resort and condominium building on the Las Vegas Strip that offers sophisticated living with world-class amenities and resort access. If your Cosmopolitan condo home DID NOT sell, you're not alone. Cosmopolitan condos face unique challenges - from competition with luxury resorts to strict building restrictions to buyers who expect exclusive access. Most agents do not understand Cosmopolitan condos. They use generic strategies, and Cosmopolitan condos expire.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Cosmopolitan condos expire for the same reasons other luxury Strip condos expire - poor marketing, minimal investment, and zero follow-up. But Cosmopolitan condos face additional challenges that most agents do not understand or address.

                  Cosmopolitan condos compete with world-class luxury resorts. Buyers can stay at The Bellagio, The Venetian, or The Wynn. Why buy a condo? Most agents do not know how to answer this question. They do not know how to position condos against luxury resorts. I do.
