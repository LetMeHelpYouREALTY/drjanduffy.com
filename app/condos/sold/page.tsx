                  These are not hypothetical success stories or marketing fluff. These are real expired condo listings that I sold after other agents failed. Every single one of these condos sat on the market for months, bleeding money, while previous agents collected nothing and sellers lost thousands. Then they called me. I reset the listing, implemented my 97-point marketing system, and sold them. Fast. At top dollar. With zero excuses.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  The numbers do not lie. I've sold 7 HOMES THAT DID NOT SELL in Las Vegas with an average of 19 days to contract and 98.7% of asking price. Many of these were condos - from luxury high-rises on The Strip to mid-rise condos in Summerlin to townhomes in Henderson. That's not a coincidence. That's not luck. That's a proven system that works for condos.

                  When you see these sold condos, you're seeing what's possible when you work with an agent who actually understands condos. Most agents show you their best-case scenarios - luxury condos in perfect condition that sold quickly. I show you expired condos. Condos that other agents could not sell. Condos that sat on the market for 60, 90, 120+ days. Then I show you how I sold them in 14-31 days at 97-99% of asking price.

                  Most agents show you their best-case scenarios - luxury condos in perfect condition that sold quickly. I show you expired condos. Condos that other agents could not sell. Condos that sat on the market for 60, 90, 120+ days. Homes that were stigmatized, overpriced, or poorly marketed. Then I show you how I sold them in 14-31 days at 97-99% of asking price.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Every single one of these sold condos shares the same pattern: Previous agent used minimal marketing (just MLS posting), DID NOT invest in professional photography, held maybe one open house, and disappeared. Then I came in, reset everything, implemented my 97-point marketing system, and sold the condo. Fast. At top dollar. The difference is not the condo. The difference is the agent.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  These sold condos faced condo-specific challenges. HOA restrictions. Competition from new construction. Seasonal demand fluctuations. Buyers who DID NOT understand condos. Most agents do not address these challenges. I do. I overcome HOA restrictions with digital marketing. I position existing condos competitively against new construction. I adjust strategies for seasonal demand. I educate buyers about condo value. That's why these condos sold.
