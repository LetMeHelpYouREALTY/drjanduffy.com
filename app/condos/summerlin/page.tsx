                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Summerlin condos expire for the same reasons other condos expire - poor marketing, minimal investment, and zero follow-up. But Summerlin condos face additional challenges that most agents do not understand or address.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Summerlin has constant new construction. New condos compete with existing condos. New amenities compete with older amenities. New pricing competes with older pricing. Most agents do not know how to position existing condos against new construction. They do not highlight unique features. They do not emphasize established communities.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Summerlin condos have HOA restrictions. No signs. Limited open houses. Restricted photography. Most agents do not know how to work within these restrictions. They try to market Summerlin condos like regular condos, hit restrictions, and give up. I know how to market Summerlin condos effectively within HOA restrictions. I use digital marketing, network activation, and targeted advertising that does not violate HOA rules.
