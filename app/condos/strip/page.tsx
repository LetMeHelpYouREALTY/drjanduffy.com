                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Strip condos expire for the same reasons other condos expire - poor marketing, minimal investment, and zero follow-up. But Strip condos face additional challenges that most agents do not understand or address.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Strip condos compete with world-class luxury resorts. Buyers can stay at The Bellagio, The Venetian, or The Wynn. Why buy a condo? Most agents do not know how to answer this question. They do not know how to position condos against luxury resorts. I do. I highlight unique features, emphasize ownership benefits, and position condos competitively against luxury resorts.

                  Strip condos have strict building restrictions. Limited open houses. Restricted photography. Complex approval processes. Most agents do not know how to work within these restrictions. They try to market Strip condos like regular condos, hit restrictions, and give up. I know how to market Strip condos effectively within building restrictions. I use digital marketing, exclusive access events, and targeted advertising that does not violate building rules.
