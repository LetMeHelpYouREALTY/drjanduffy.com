                  your home DIDN\'T sell because your previous agent didn\'t
                  have a process. They posted to MLS, held maybe one open house,
                  and hoped for the best. That's not a process. That's
                  incompetence. I have a proven 5-step process that sells homes
                  that DIDN\'T sell. Fast. At top dollar. With zero excuses.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  The selling process is broken down into five clear steps, each
                  with specific deliverables and timelines. Step 1 is initial
                  consultation. Step 2 is strategic reset. Step 3 is aggressive
                  marketing launch. Step 4 is active negotiation. Step 5 is
                  closing and escrow. Every step has measurable outcomes. Every
                  step moves you closer to SOLD.

                  Most agents don't have a process. They wing it. They post to
                  MLS and hope. They hold one open house and pray. They wait for
                  offers and accept whatever comes. That's not how you sell
                  homes. That's how you get expired.

                      Week 2-3 is when offers come in and negotiations begin.
                      This is where most agents fail. They accept lowball offers
                      or let negotiations drag on. I use aggressive follow-up,
                      buyer psychology tactics, and strategic counter-offers to
                      get you top dollar. I don't wait for offers. I create
                      them.

                      Active negotiation is where I maximize your sale price.
                      Your previous agent probably accepted the first offer or
                      let negotiations drag on. I use aggressive follow-up to
                      create urgency. Buyer psychology tactics to create
                      competition. Strategic counter-offers to maximize price.
                      Inspection negotiation to protect your interests.
                      Appraisal protection to ensure sale price. I don't accept
                      lowball offers. I negotiate them up. I don't let deals
                      fall apart. I manage every detail. This aggressive
                      negotiation is how I get 98.7% of asking price average,
                      not 92% or 95%.

                      Closing and escrow is where deals fall apart with other
