                  your home DID NOT sell because your previous agent DID NOT have a process. They posted to MLS, held maybe one open house, and hoped for the best. That's not a process. That's incompetence. I have a proven 5-step process that sells homes that DID NOT sell. Fast. At top dollar. With zero excuses.

                  The selling process is broken down into five clear steps, each with specific deliverables and timelines. Step 1 is initial consultation. Step 2 is strategic reset. Step 3 is aggressive marketing launch. Step 4 is active negotiation. Step 5 is closing and escrow. Every step has measurable outcomes. Every step moves you closer to SOLD.
