      question: 'What sells a house the fastest?',
      answer:
        'Three things sell houses fastest: professional marketing, strategic pricing, and aggressive follow-up. Professional photography increases showing requests by 300% and sale price by 5-10%. Strategic pricing based on market data positions your home competitively from day one. Aggressive follow-up on every showing turns interest into offers. I invest $5,000+ in marketing per listing and use a 97-point marketing system. This comprehensive approach is why I average 19 days to contract on homes that did not sell. Learn more about my proven selling process and marketing strategy.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the quickest way to sell your house?',
      answer:
        'The quickest way to sell your house is a complete reset with professional marketing and strategic pricing. This means: fresh professional photography ($3,700 investment), strategic pricing based on market analysis, fresh MLS listing with optimized description, aggressive marketing across multiple channels, and relentless follow-up on all showings. I have sold 7 homes that did not sell using this approach, averaging 19 days to contract and 98.7% of asking price. The key is not waiting - every day costs you $116 in holding costs. See my 30-day selling process for the complete strategy.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I sell my house to Opendoor, Offerpad, or a cash buyer?',
      answer:
        'Cash buyers like Opendoor and Offerpad typically offer 70-85% of market value, meaning you lose $30,000-$60,000 on a $400,000 home. They also charge service fees (5-12%) and make deductions for repairs. My approach gets you 98.7% of asking price on average - that\'s $15,000-$40,000 more than cash buyers, and I close in 19 days. You get top dollar AND fast closing. The only time cash buyers make sense is if you need to close in 7 days or less. Otherwise, my proven system gets you more money in similar timeframes.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I sell my house fast for cash in Las Vegas?',
      answer:
        'If you need cash fast, you have two options: 1) Sell to a cash buyer (Opendoor, Offerpad, "we buy houses" companies) and accept 70-85% of market value, or 2) Use my proven system to get 98.7% of asking price and close in 19 days. Most sellers choose option 2 because they get $15,000-$40,000 more while still closing fast. I work with cash buyers and traditional buyers, ensuring you get the best offer. Call 702-500-1064 to compare your options.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I sell my house fast without repairs in Las Vegas?',
      answer:
        'Yes! I sell homes "as-is" all the time. Unlike cash buyers who deduct heavily for repairs, I market your home strategically to buyers who want as-is properties. My professional photography and staging make even homes needing work look appealing. I\'ve sold 7 homes that did not sell with other agents, many needing repairs. The key is proper pricing and marketing, not expensive renovations. Get a free consultation to see how we can sell your home as-is fast.',

                Why Las Vegas Houses do not Sell Fast (And How to Fix It)
              </h2>
              <HeadingMedia level={2} heading="Why Las Vegas Houses do not Sell Fast (And How to Fix It)" />
              <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  Most Las Vegas houses do not sell fast because of five common mistakes. Your previous agent probably made at least three of them. Understanding what went wrong is the first step to fixing it.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">1. Overpricing</h3>
                <HeadingMedia level={3} heading="1. Overpricing" />
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  The number one reason houses do not sell fast is overpricing. Your previous agent probably told you what you wanted to hear about price, not the truth. Then they suggested price drop after price drop. That's not a strategy. That's incompetence. I use data-driven pricing and market analysis to price your home right from day one. I do not guess. I analyze. I price strategically to attract qualified buyers while maximizing your sale price. The result? 98.7% of asking price average, not 92% or 95%.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">2. Poor Photography</h3>
                <HeadingMedia level={3} heading="2. Poor Photography" />
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Your previous agent used iPhone photos. Dark rooms, cluttered spaces, unprofessional staging. Buyers scroll through hundreds of listings online. If your photos do not grab them immediately, they move on. I invest $3,700 in professional media - twilight drone shots, 3D virtual tours, magazine-quality staging. Professional photography increases showing requests by 300% and sale price by 5-10%. This is what $3,700 buys you. This is what your previous agent DID NOT provide.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">3. Weak Marketing Strategy</h3>
                <HeadingMedia level={3} heading="3. Weak Marketing Strategy" />
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  "Posted to MLS" is not a strategy. One open house, zero follow-up, no buyer targeting. Your house becomes invisible. I use a 97-point marketing system that includes social media blitzes, network activation (500+ agents), targeted Facebook/Google ads, strategic open houses, and email marketing campaigns. This comprehensive system ensures your home gets maximum exposure to qualified buyers.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">4. Zero Follow-Up</h3>
                <HeadingMedia level={3} heading="4. Zero Follow-Up" />
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Your previous agent had zero follow-up. Buyers saw your home, but your agent never followed up. Feedback disappeared. Opportunities were lost. I have an aggressive follow-up system that ensures every showing is tracked, every buyer is contacted, and every opportunity is maximized. I do not wait for offers. I create them. This aggressive follow-up is what turns showings into offers and offers into sales.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">5. Part-Time Effort</h3>
                <HeadingMedia level={3} heading="5. Part-Time Effort" />
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Your previous agent had 47+ listings. You got 2.1% of their attention. They could not afford to invest $5,000+ in every listing. They spread themselves thin, hoping something would stick. I take maximum 6 listings at a time. You get 100% focus. Every home gets the full treatment - professional marketing, aggressive follow-up, strategic negotiation. Nothing is left to chance.

                  Selling your house fast in Las Vegas requires a complete strategy, not a "post to MLS and pray" approach. Here's the proven system that works:
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">Week 1: Complete Marketing Reset</h3>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  The first week is all about reset. Professional photography and staging ($3,700 investment). 3D virtual tour creation. Market analysis and strategic pricing. Fresh MLS listing with optimized description. Social media marketing blitz launch. This complete reset eliminates the stigma of unsold homes. Buyers see a beautiful, properly priced home with professional marketing. They do not see "DID NOT sell." They see "opportunity."
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">Week 2: Maximum Exposure</h3>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Week 2 is maximum exposure. Strategic open house with buyer pre-qualification. Network activation reaching 500+ agents. Targeted Facebook and Google ads. Email marketing to qualified buyers. Daily follow-up on all showings. This aggressive marketing creates momentum and generates offers.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">Week 3: Active Negotiation</h3>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Week 3 is when offers come in and negotiations begin. I use aggressive follow-up, buyer psychology tactics, and strategic counter-offers to get you top dollar. I do not accept lowball offers. I negotiate them up. This aggressive negotiation is how I get 98.7% of asking price average.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">Week 4: Closing</h3>

                  Week 4 is closing. Escrow management, timeline enforcement, problem resolution, final walkthrough coordination. I manage every detail through closing. This complete management ensures your sale closes smoothly and on time.
