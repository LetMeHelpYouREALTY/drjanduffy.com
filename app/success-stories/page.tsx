                These are not hypothetical success stories or marketing fluff. These are real HOMES THAT DID NOT SELL that I sold after other agents failed. Every single one of these homes sat on the market for months, bleeding money, while previous agents collected nothing and sellers lost thousands. Then they called me. I reset the listing, implemented my <a href="/marketing-strategy" className="text-primary font-semibold hover:underline">97-point marketing system</a>, and sold them. Fast. At top dollar. With zero excuses.

                The numbers do not lie. I've sold 7 Summerlin sellers who could not sell with an average of 19 days to contract and 98.7% of asking price. That's not a coincidence. That's not luck. That's a proven system that works. When you see these success stories, you're seeing what's possible when you work with an agent who actually knows what they're doing.

                Most agents show you their best-case scenarios - luxury homes in perfect condition that sold quickly. I show you HOMES THAT DID NOT SELL. Homes that other agents could not sell. Homes that sat on the market for 60, 90, 120+ days. Homes that were stigmatized, overpriced, or poorly marketed. Then I show you how I sold them in 14-31 days at 97-99% of asking price.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Every single one of these success stories shares the same pattern: Previous agent used minimal marketing (just MLS posting), DID NOT invest in professional photography, held maybe one open house, and disappeared. Then I came in, reset everything, implemented my 97-point marketing system, and sold the home. Fast. At top dollar. The difference is not the home. The difference is the agent.

                  These are not cherry-picked success stories. These are real HOMES THAT DID NOT SELL that I sold after other agents failed. Every single one of these homes had the same problems: poor marketing, minimal investment, zero follow-up. Then I came in, reset everything, and sold them. Fast. At top dollar.

                  The average HOME THAT DID NOT SELL in Las Vegas sits for 63+ days before expiring. Then it sits expired for another 30-90 days before someone finally sells it (if they sell it at all). I sell them in 19 days average. That's not a coincidence. That's a proven system.
