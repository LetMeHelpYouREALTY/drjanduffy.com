                  Summerlin buyers are different. They're high-net-worth individuals, second-home buyers, retirees, and executives. They expect professional marketing, strategic pricing, and active agent involvement. They do not respond to generic "post to MLS and pray" strategies. They respond to targeted, high-end marketing.

Newer villages (new construction, $600K-$2M+). Each requires different marketing strategies, buyer targeting, and pricing approaches.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Summerlin buyers want the lifestyle. Golf course living. Mountain views. Resort-style amenities. Active adult communities. New construction with modern finishes. Your marketing needs to showcase the lifestyle, not just the home. Professional photography that captures the lifestyle. Descriptions that sell the experience.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">Quality & Condition</h3>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Summerlin buyers expect quality. Updated kitchens, modern bathrooms, luxury finishes, well-maintained properties. Deferred maintenance is a deal-breaker. Professional staging makes your home look like it belongs in a design magazine. This is what attracts luxury buyers.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">Location & Neighborhood</h3>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Summerlin buyers care about location. The Ridges (ultra-luxury, exclusivity). Red Rock Country Club (golf course, active adult). The Summit (high-rise, urban luxury). Newer villages (new construction, modern amenities). Each neighborhood attracts different buyers. Your marketing needs to highlight neighborhood advantages.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">Price & Value</h3>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Summerlin buyers are educated. They know market values. They compare your home to new construction, resale homes, and off-market properties. Strategic pricing is critical. Too high (sits on market). Too low (leaves money on table). Just right (sells fast at top dollar). I use data-driven pricing to price your home right from day one.
