                  Your listing expired. Your agent could not sell it. You're frustrated, angry, and losing money every day. The average unsold home costs sellers $4,964 per month in holding costs. That's $116 per day. Every day you wait is money down the drain.

                  But here is the truth: you cannot keep doing what DID NOT work. Relisting with the same strategy, same photos, same pricing, same agent - that is insanity. You need a complete reset. New photos. New pricing strategy. Fresh MLS listing. Aggressive marketing. This is what I do. I have helped 7 sellers who could not sell with their previous agent. Average 19 days to contract. 98.7% of asking price.

                  Relisting with the same strategy is like doing the same thing and expecting different results. It does not work. Here's why:
                </p>
                <div className="bg-red-50 border-2 border-red-200 rounded-lg p-8 mb-6">
                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-red-800">Same Photos, Same Problem</h3>
                  <HeadingMedia level={3} heading="Same Photos, Same Problem" />
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Your previous agent used iPhone photos. Dark rooms, cluttered spaces, unprofessional staging. Relisting with the same photos means buyers see the same problems. They scroll past. Your home stays invisible.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    I invest $3,700 in professional media - twilight drone shots, 3D virtual tours, magazine-quality staging. Professional photography increases showing requests by 300% and sale price by 5-10%. This is what gets homes sold.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div className="bg-red-50 border-2 border-red-200 rounded-lg p-8 mb-6">

                  <HeadingMedia level={3} heading="Same Pricing, Same Result" />
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Your previous agent overpriced your home. Then they suggested price drop after price drop. Relisting with the same pricing strategy means the same problem. Too high (sits on market). Too low (leaves money on table).
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    I use data-driven pricing and market analysis to price your home right from day one. I analyze comparable sales, market trends, buyer psychology, and competitive positioning. I price strategically to attract qualified buyers while maximizing your sale price. The result? 98.7% of asking price average.

                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Your previous agent posted to MLS and disappeared. One open house, zero follow-up, no buyer targeting. Relisting with the same marketing means the same invisibility. Buyers never see your home.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    I use a 97-point marketing system that includes social media blitzes, network activation (500+ agents), targeted Facebook/Google ads, strategic open houses, and email marketing campaigns. This comprehensive system ensures your home gets maximum exposure to qualified buyers.

                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Your previous agent had 47+ listings. You got 2.1% of their attention. They could not afford to invest $5,000+ in every listing. Relisting with the same agent means the same part-time effort. Your listing gets lost in the shuffle.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    I take maximum 6 listings at a time. You get 100% focus. Every home gets the full treatment - professional marketing, aggressive follow-up, strategic negotiation. Nothing is left to chance. This focus is what separates successful sales from failed listings.

                  I use data-driven pricing and market analysis to price your home right from day one. I do not just lower the price.

The result? 98.7% of asking price average, not 92% or 95%.
