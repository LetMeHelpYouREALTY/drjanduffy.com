                Your listing expired. Your agent couldn\'t sell it. You need a

                  Your listing expired. Your agent couldn't sell it. You're
                  frustrated, angry, and losing money every day. The average
                  unsold home costs sellers $4,964 per month in holding costs.
                  That's $116 per day. Every day you wait is money down the
                  drain.

                  But here's the truth: you can\'t keep doing what DIDN\'T work.
                  Relisting with the same strategy, same photos, same pricing,
                  same agent - that's insanity. You need a complete reset. New
                  photos. New pricing strategy. Fresh MLS listing. Aggressive
                  marketing. This is what I do. I've helped 47 sellers who
                  couldn\'t sell with their previous agent. Average 19 days to
                  contract. 98.7% of asking price. See{' '}

                Why Relisting With the Same Strategy Fails

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  Relisting with the same strategy is like doing the same thing
                  and expecting different results. It doesn't work. Here's why:
                </p>
                <div className="bg-red-50 border-2 border-red-200 rounded-lg p-8 mb-6">

                    Same Photos, Same Problem
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Your previous agent used iPhone photos. Dark rooms,
                    cluttered spaces, unprofessional staging. Relisting with the
                    same photos means buyers see the same problems. They scroll
                    past. Your home stays invisible.

                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    I invest $3,700 in professional media - twilight drone
                    shots, 3D virtual tours, magazine-quality staging.
                    Professional photography increases showing requests by 300%
                    and sale price by 5-10%. This is what gets homes sold.

                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Your previous agent overpriced your home. Then they
                    suggested price drop after price drop. Relisting with the
                    same pricing strategy means the same problem. Too high (sits
                    on market). Too low (leaves money on table).

                    Your previous agent posted to MLS and disappeared. One open

                    the same marketing means the same invisibility. Buyers never

                    listing. Relisting with the same agent means the same
                    part-time effort. Your listing gets lost in the shuffle.

                    aggressive follow-up, strategic negotiation. Nothing is left
                    to chance. This focus is what separates successful sales
