                  Your previous agent failed you because they didn\'t provide
                  complete services. They took iPhone photos, posted to MLS,
                  held maybe one open house, and disappeared. That's not
                  service. That's negligence. I provide complete services that
                  transform HOMES THAT DIDN\'T SELL into successful sales. Every

                  The difference between my services and your previous agent's
                  services is dramatic. They spent $100. I spend $5,000+. They
                  used minimal marketing. I use a 97-point marketing system.
                  They had zero follow-up. I have aggressive follow-up. They
                  made promises. I deliver proven results. The result? They got
                  you expired. I get you sold. Fast. At top dollar. With zero
                  excuses.

                      Professional photos increase showing requests by 300% and
                      sale price by 5-10%. Twilight drone shots showcase your
                      property at its best. 3D virtual tours allow buyers to
                      tour your home 24/7. Magazine-quality staging makes your
                      home look like it belongs in a design magazine. This isn't
                      optional. This is essential. HOMES THAT DIDN\'T SELL need
                      professional media to overcome stigma and attract
                      qualified buyers.

                      price, inspection negotiation to protect your interests,
                      and appraisal protection to ensure sale price. This
                      aggressive system ensures every showing leads to an offer,
                      and every offer leads to top dollar. This is how I get
                      98.7% of asking price average. This is how your previous
                      agent got you expired.

                      Your previous agent disappeared after getting an offer. I
                      manage every detail through closing. Escrow management

                      issues as they arise. Final walkthrough coordination
                      ensures smooth closing. Closing management ensures all
                      documents are signed. Post-closing support ensures you're
                      satisfied with the process.

                      management ensures your sale closes smoothly and on time.
                      This is where deals fall apart with other agents. I don't

                  The difference between my services and your previous agent's

                  used minimal marketing. I use a 97-point marketing system.
                  They had zero follow-up. I have aggressive follow-up. They
                  made promises. I deliver proven results.
