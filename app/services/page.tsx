      question: 'At what point is a house not worth fixing?',
      answer:
        'A house is not worth fixing when repair costs exceed potential value increase, or when strategic marketing investment would yield better returns. For homes that did not sell, the focus should be on presentation and marketing fixes rather than major structural repairs. I invest $3,700 in professional photography and staging, which increases sale price by 5-10% - far more than most repairs. Strategic pricing and aggressive marketing often solve "fix" problems without expensive renovations. The key is understanding what fixes actually help sell homes versus what is over-investment. I help clients evaluate which improvements will maximize sale price and speed, focusing on high-impact, low-cost solutions. Learn more about my complete services and proven selling process.',

                  Your previous agent failed you because they DID NOT bring buyers. They took iPhone photos, posted to MLS, held maybe one open house, and disappeared. They listed and waited.

Every service is designed to bring qualified buyers: aggressive marketing, strategic pricing, and relentless follow-up.

I use a 97-point marketing system that brings buyers. They had zero follow-up. I have aggressive follow-up that converts interest into offers. They listed and waited. I bring buyers. They made promises. I deliver proven results. The result? They got you expired. I bring buyers and get you sold. Fast. At top dollar. With zero excuses.

                      Your previous agent used iPhone photos. I use professional photography worth $3,700. The difference is dramatic. Professional photos increase showing requests by 300% and sale price by 5-10%. Twilight drone shots showcase your property at its best. 3D virtual tours allow buyers to tour your home 24/7. Magazine-quality staging makes your home look like it belongs in a design magazine. This is not optional. This is essential. HOMES THAT DID NOT SELL need professional media to overcome stigma and attract qualified buyers.

                      Your previous agent posted to MLS with a generic description and iPhone photos.

                      Your previous agent used a "post to MLS and pray" strategy. I use a 97-point marketing system that leaves nothing to chance. Social media marketing blitz reaches thousands of potential buyers. Network activation reaches 500+ agents who can bring qualified buyers. Targeted Facebook and Google ads reach buyers actively searching for homes. Strategic open houses with buyer pre-qualification attract serious buyers. Email marketing campaigns reach qualified buyers in your price range.

                      Your previous agent had zero follow-up. Buyers saw your home, but your agent never followed up. Feedback disappeared. Opportunities were lost. I have an aggressive follow-up system that ensures every showing is tracked, every buyer is contacted, and every opportunity is maximized. I do not wait for offers. I create them. I do not accept lowball offers. I negotiate them up.
                    </p>

This aggressive system ensures every showing leads to an offer, and every offer leads to top dollar. This is how I get 98.7% of asking price average. This is how your previous agent got you expired.

Post-closing support ensures you are satisfied with the process.

                  The difference between my services and your previous agent's services is dramatic. They spent $100. I spend $5,000+. They used minimal marketing. I use a 97-point marketing system. They had zero follow-up. I have aggressive follow-up. They made promises. I deliver proven results.

                      Your previous agent's minimal services cost you thousands. The $100 investment was not enough to sell your home. The lack of marketing made your home invisible. The zero follow-up lost opportunities. This is what minimal services get you: a HOME THAT did not SELL.
