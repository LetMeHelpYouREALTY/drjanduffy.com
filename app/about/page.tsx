                    My approach is different. I do not use the "post to MLS and pray" strategy that got your home DID NOT sell in the first place. I invest $5,000+ in professional marketing per listing. I take maximum 6 listings at a time so you get 100% focus, not 2.1% like with big franchise agents.

                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    Most agents avoid HOMES THAT DID NOT SELL. They see them as damaged goods or too much work. They think HOMES That DID NOT SELL are stigmatized, overpriced, or have problems. They are wrong. I see HOMES THAT DID NOT SELL as opportunities - homes that just need the right agent, the right strategy, and the right marketing.

                  <HeadingMedia level={3} heading="The Psychology of Frustrated Sellers" />
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    Frustrated sellers are frustrated, motivated, and ready to work with someone who actually knows what they are doing. They have already been failed once - they will not accept failure again. They are educated about the process. They understand the market. They are realistic about pricing. They are ready to make decisions quickly. And most importantly, they are willing to pay full commission to someone who can actually sell their home.
                  </p>
                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Opportunity</h3>
                  <HeadingMedia level={3} heading="The Opportunity" />
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    In Las Vegas, 20-30% of all homes fail to sell every year. That is 1,500-2,250 homes that sat on the market for months, bleeding money, while agents collected nothing and sellers lost thousands. These are not bad homes. These are homes that had bad agents. With the right agent, the right strategy, and the right marketing, these homes sell. Fast. At top dollar. With zero excuses.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg">
                    That is where I come in. I take the homes that other agents could not sell and I sell them. Fast. At top dollar. With zero excuses. I have done it 7 times. I can do it for you too.

                  <HeadingMedia level={2} heading="The Dr. Jan Difference" />
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    What makes me different from your previous agent? It is not just experience or credentials - it is my approach, my investment, and my proven results.
                  </p>
                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Maximum Focus</h3>
                  <HeadingMedia level={3} heading="Maximum Focus" />
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    I take maximum 6 listings at a time. Your previous agent had 47+ listings. You got 2.1% of their attention. With me, you get 100% focus. Every listing gets the full treatment - professional marketing, aggressive follow-up, strategic negotiation. Nothing is left to chance.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    The difference between 2.1% focus and 100% focus is dramatic. Your previous agent could not afford to invest $5,000+ in every listing because they had 47 of them. They spread themselves thin, hoping something would stick. I focus intensely on a few listings, ensuring each one gets the full treatment. This focus is what separates successful sales from homes that DID NOT sell.
                  </p>
                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Real Investment</h3>
                  <HeadingMedia level={3} heading="Real Investment" />
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    I invest $5,000+ in marketing per listing. Your previous agent spent $37 on photos. I spend $3,700 on professional media - twilight drone shots, 3D virtual tours, magazine-quality staging. I use a 97-point marketing system that includes social media blitzes, network activation, targeted ads, and strategic open houses. Your previous agent posted to MLS and disappeared.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    The $5,000+ investment pays for itself through faster sales and higher prices. Professional photography increases showing requests by 300% and sale price by 5-10%. Strategic marketing brings qualified buyers. Aggressive follow-up creates urgency. The investment is not a cost - it is an investment in your success. Your previous agent saw it as a cost and minimized it. I see it as an investment and maximize it.
                  </p>
                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Proven Results</h3>

                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    I deliver proven results. 7 homes that DID NOT sell - now sold with an average of 19 days to contract and 98.7% of asking price. Weekly updates with real accountability. Professional photos worth $3,700+. Your previous agent made promises. I deliver proven results with real consequences.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    The results speak for themselves: 7 homes that DID NOT sell - now sold, 19 day average, 98.7% of asking price. These are not hypothetical results. These are real HOMES THAT DID NOT SELL that I sold after other agents failed. The same system that delivered these results can deliver yours. The only question is: are you ready to work with an agent who actually delivers results?

                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    I DID NOT start as a Failed Listing Specialist. I started like most agents - taking any listing I could get, hoping for the best. But I quickly learned that most agents fail because they do not have a system. They do not invest in marketing. They do not follow up. They do not deliver results. I decided to be different.
                  </p>
                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Turning Point</h3>
                  <HeadingMedia level={3} heading="The Turning Point" />
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    The turning point came when I saw my first HOME THAT DID NOT SELL. The seller was frustrated. The previous agent had failed. The listing had expired. But the home was beautiful. It was properly priced. It just needed the right agent, the right strategy, and the right marketing. I took it on, implemented my system, and sold it in 14 days at 99% of asking price. That is when I knew HOMES THAT DID NOT SELL were not problems - they were opportunities.
                  </p>

                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    After that first success, I refined my system. I invested more in marketing. I developed the 97-point marketing system. I created the aggressive follow-up process. I built the strategic negotiation tactics. Each HOME THAT DID NOT SELL taught me something new. Each success validated the system. After 7 HOMES THAT DID NOT SELL, I have a proven system that works. Fast. At top dollar. With zero excuses.
                  </p>
                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Specialization</h3>

                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    Most agents avoid HOMES That DID NOT SELL. They see them as damaged goods or too much work. I see them as opportunities. I specialize in HOMES THAT DID NOT SELL because I know how to fix them. I know how to reset them. I know how to market them. I know how to sell them. This specialization is what makes me different. This specialization is what delivers results.

                    If your home did not sell, you need an agent who actually knows what they are doing. You need an agent who specializes in HOMES THAT DID NOT SELL. You need an agent who delivers proven results. That is me. I have sold 7 Summerlin sellers who could not sell with an average of 19 days to contract and 98.7% of asking price. The same system that delivered these results can deliver yours.
