                    While other agents give up on HOMES THAT DIDN\'T SELL, Dr.
                    Jan specializes in turning failed listings into successful
                    sales through aggressive marketing, data-driven pricing, and
                    relentless follow-up. Most agents see HOMES THAT didn\'t
                    SELL as damaged goods or too much work. I see them as
                    opportunities - homes that just need the right agent, the
                    right strategy, and the right marketing.

                    My approach is different. I don't use the "post to MLS and

                    Why HOMES THAT DIDN\'T SELL?
                  </h2>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    Most agents avoid HOMES THAT didn\'t SELL. They see them as
                    damaged goods or too much work. They think HOMES That
                    Didn\'t SELL are stigmatized, overpriced, or have problems.
                    They're wrong. I see HOMES THAT DIDN\'T SELL as
                    opportunities - homes that just need the right agent, the
                    right strategy, and the right marketing.

                    The Psychology of frustrated sellers
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    frustrated sellers are frustrated, motivated, and ready to
                    work with someone who actually knows what they're doing.
                    They've already been failed once - they won\'t accept
                    failure again. They're educated about the process. They
                    understand the market. They're realistic about pricing.
                    They're ready to make decisions quickly. And most
                    importantly, they're willing to pay full commission to
                    someone who can actually sell their home.
                  </p>
                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Opportunity</h3>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    In Las Vegas, 20-30% of all homes fail to sell every year.
                    That's 1,500-2,250 homes that sat on the market for months,
                    bleeding money, while agents collected nothing and sellers
                    lost thousands. These aren't bad homes. These are homes that
                    had bad agents. With the right agent, the right strategy,
                    and the right marketing, these homes sell. Fast. At top
                    dollar. With zero excuses.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg">
                    That's where I come in. I take the homes that other agents
                    couldn\'t sell and I sell them. Fast. At top dollar. With
                    zero excuses. I've done it 47 times. I can do it for you
                    too.

                    The Dr. Jan Difference
                  </h2>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    What makes me different from your previous agent? It's not
                    just experience or credentials - it's my approach, my
                    investment, and my proven results.
                  </p>
                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Maximum Focus</h3>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    I take maximum 6 listings at a time. Your previous agent had
                    47+ listings. You got 2.1% of their attention. With me, you
                    get 100% focus. Every listing gets the full treatment -
                    professional marketing, aggressive follow-up, strategic
                    negotiation. Nothing is left to chance.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    The difference between 2.1% focus and 100% focus is
                    dramatic. Your previous agent couldn\'t afford to invest
                    $5,000+ in every listing because they had 47 of them. They
                    spread themselves thin, hoping something would stick. I
                    focus intensely on a few listings, ensuring each one gets
                    the full treatment. This focus is what separates successful
                    sales from homes that DIDN\'T sell.
                  </p>
                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Real Investment</h3>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    I invest $5,000+ in marketing per listing. Your previous
                    agent spent $37 on photos. I spend $3,700 on professional
                    media - twilight drone shots, 3D virtual tours,
                    magazine-quality staging. I use a 97-point marketing system
                    that includes social media blitzes, network activation,
                    targeted ads, and strategic open houses. Your previous agent
                    posted to MLS and disappeared.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    The $5,000+ investment pays for itself through faster sales
                    and higher prices. Professional photography increases
                    showing requests by 300% and sale price by 5-10%. Strategic
                    marketing brings qualified buyers. Aggressive follow-up
                    creates urgency. The investment isn't a cost - it's an
                    investment in your success. Your previous agent saw it as a
                    cost and minimized it. I see it as an investment and
                    maximize it.
                  </p>
                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Proven Results</h3>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    I deliver proven results. 47 homes that DIDN\'T sell - now
                    sold with an average of 19 days to contract and 98.7% of
                    asking price. Weekly updates with real accountability.
                    Professional photos worth $3,700+. Your previous agent made
                    promises. I deliver proven results with real consequences.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    The results speak for themselves: 47 homes that didn\'t sell
                    - now sold, 19 day average, 98.7% of asking price. These
                    aren't hypothetical results. These are real HOMES THAT
                    DIDN\'T SELL that I sold after other agents failed. The same
                    system that delivered these results can deliver yours. The
                    only question is: are you ready to work with an agent who
                    actually delivers results?

                    My Journey to failed listing specialistise
                  </h2>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    I didn\'t start as an failed listing specialist. I started
                    like most agents - taking any listing I could get, hoping
                    for the best. But I quickly learned that most agents fail
                    because they don't have a system. They don't invest in
                    marketing. They don't follow up. They don't deliver results.
                    I decided to be different.
                  </p>
                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Turning Point</h3>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    The turning point came when I saw my first HOME THAT DIDN\'T
                    SELL. The seller was frustrated. The previous agent had
                    failed. The listing had expired. But the home was beautiful.
                    It was properly priced. It just needed the right agent, the
                    right strategy, and the right marketing. I took it on,
                    implemented my system, and sold it in 14 days at 99% of
                    asking price. That's when I knew HOMES THAT didn\'t SELL
                    weren't problems - they were opportunities.
                  </p>

                    Building the System
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    After that first success, I refined my system. I invested
                    more in marketing. I developed the 97-point marketing
                    system. I created the aggressive follow-up process. I built
                    the strategic negotiation tactics. Each HOME THAT DIDN\'T
                    SELL taught me something new. Each success validated the
                    system. After 47 HOMES THAT didn\'t SELL, I have a proven
                    system that works. Fast. At top dollar. With zero excuses.

                    The Specialization
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    Most agents avoid HOMES That Didn\'t SELL. They see them as
                    damaged goods or too much work. I see them as opportunities.
                    I specialize in HOMES THAT DIDN\'T SELL because I know how
                    to fix them. I know how to reset them. I know how to market
                    them. I know how to sell them. This specialization is what
                    makes me different. This specialization is what delivers
                    results.

                    If your home didn't sell, you need an agent who actually

                    these results can deliver yours.
