    question: "Why won't my house sell?",
    answer:
      "The most common reasons houses don't sell are: overpricing, poor photography, weak marketing strategy, zero follow-up, and part-time agent effort. Your previous agent likely made at least three of these mistakes. I specialize in fixing these issues with a complete marketing reset, strategic pricing, and aggressive follow-up.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How long should I wait before relisting?',
    answer:
      "Don't wait. Every day your home sits unsold costs you $116+ in holding costs. The longer it sits, the more it becomes stigmatized. If your listing expired or your home has been on the market 60+ days with no offers, it's time to relist with a different strategy. I can help you relist and sell your home in 30 days or less.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I lower my price if my house won't sell?",
    answer:
      "Lowering price alone won't fix the problem if your marketing is weak. The issue is usually a combination of pricing AND marketing. I use data-driven pricing analysis to price your home right from day one, combined with professional marketing that attracts qualified buyers. This approach gets you top dollar, not just a lower price.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the average time to sell in Las Vegas?",
    answer:
      "The average time to sell in Las Vegas varies by price range and neighborhood. For homes that didn't sell with other agents, I average 19 days to contract. For properly priced and marketed homes in Summerlin, the average is 30-45 days. The key is professional marketing, strategic pricing, and active agent involvement.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does it cost when my house sits unsold?',
    answer:
      "The average unsold home costs sellers $4,964 per month in holding costs. That's $116 per day. This includes mortgage payments, HOA fees, insurance, utilities, and property taxes. Plus, there are hidden costs: lost opportunity, market depreciation, and emotional toll. The longer it sits, the more it costs you.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What makes you different from my previous agent?',
    answer:
      "I invest $5,000+ in marketing per listing (vs. $100). I take maximum 6 listings at a time (vs. 47+). I use a 97-point marketing system (vs. post to MLS and pray). I have aggressive follow-up (vs. zero follow-up). I specialize in homes that didn't sell (vs. avoiding them). The result: 47 homes that didn't sell - now sold, 19 day average, 98.7% of asking price.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you really sell my home if it didn't sell before?",
    answer:
      "Yes. I've sold 47 homes that didn't sell with other agents. Average 19 days to contract, 98.7% of asking price. The key is a complete reset: new professional photos, strategic pricing analysis, fresh MLS listing, and aggressive marketing. The stigma disappears when buyers see a beautiful, properly priced home with professional marketing.",

                If your home won't sell, you're not alone. In Las Vegas, 20-30%
                of all homes fail to sell on their first try every year.

                  Your home won\'t sell. You've tried. Your agent tried. Nothing
                  worked. You're frustrated, angry, and losing money every day.
                  The average unsold home costs sellers $4,964 per month in
                  holding costs. That's $116 per day. Every day you wait is
                  money down the drain.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  But here's the truth: your home DIDN\'T fail. Your agent did.
                  I specialize in homes that won\'t sell. I've helped 47
                  Summerlin sellers who couldn\'t sell with their previous
                  agent. Average 19 days to contract. 98.7% of asking price.

                    1. Overpricing
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Your previous agent probably told you what you wanted to
                    hear about price, not the truth. They wanted the listing, so
                    they overpriced it. Then, when it DIDN\'T sell, they
                    suggested price drop after price drop. That's not a
                    strategy. That's incompetence.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    I use data-driven pricing and market analysis to price your
                    home right from day one. I analyze comparable sales, market
                    trends, buyer psychology, and competitive positioning. I
                    don't guess. I analyze. I price strategically to attract
                    qualified buyers while maximizing your sale price. The
                    result? 98.7% of asking price average, not 92% or 95%.

                    2. Poor Photography & Presentation
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Your previous agent used iPhone photos. Dark rooms,
                    cluttered spaces, unprofessional staging. Buyers scroll
                    through hundreds of listings online. If your photos don't
                    grab them immediately, they move on. Your home becomes
                    invisible.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    I invest $3,700 in professional media - twilight drone
                    shots, 3D virtual tours, magazine-quality staging.
                    Professional photography increases showing requests by 300%
                    and sale price by 5-10%. This is what $3,700 buys you. This
                    is what your previous agent DIDN\'T provide.

                    3. Weak Marketing Strategy
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    "Posted to MLS" is not a strategy. One open house, zero
                    follow-up, no buyer targeting. Your house becomes invisible.
                    Buyers never even see it.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    I use a 97-point marketing system that includes social media
                    blitzes, network activation (500+ agents), targeted
                    Facebook/Google ads, strategic open houses, and email
                    marketing campaigns. This comprehensive system ensures your
                    home gets maximum exposure to qualified buyers. This is what
                    $5,000+ buys you. This is what your previous agent didn\'t
                    provide.

                    4. Zero Follow-Up
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Your previous agent had zero follow-up. Buyers saw your
                    home, but your agent never followed up. Feedback
                    disappeared. Opportunities were lost. Showings happened, but
                    nothing came of them.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    I have an aggressive follow-up system that ensures every
                    showing is tracked, every buyer is contacted, and every
                    opportunity is maximized. I follow up within 2 hours of
                    every showing. I collect detailed feedback. I create urgency
                    through buyer psychology tactics. I don't wait for offers. I
                    create them. This aggressive follow-up is what turns
                    showings into offers and offers into sales.

                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Your previous agent had 47+ listings. You got 2.1% of their
                    attention. They couldn\'t afford to invest $5,000+ in every
                    listing. They spread themselves thin, hoping something would
                    stick. Your listing got lost in the shuffle.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    I take maximum 6 listings at a time. You get 100% focus.
                    Every home gets the full treatment - professional marketing,
                    aggressive follow-up, strategic negotiation. Nothing is left
                    to chance. This focus is what separates successful sales
                    from unsold homes.

                  The first step is a complete marketing reset. Professional
                  photography and staging ($3,700 investment). 3D virtual tour
                  creation. Market analysis and strategic pricing. Fresh MLS
                  listing with optimized description. Social media marketing
                  blitz launch. This complete reset eliminates the stigma of
                  unsold homes. Buyers see a beautiful, properly priced home
                  with professional marketing. They don't see "DIDN\'T sell."
                  They see "opportunity."
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">
                  Step 2: Strategic Pricing Analysis
                </h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Most homes that won\'t sell are overpriced. But lowering price
                  alone won't fix the problem if your marketing is weak. I use
                  data-driven pricing and market analysis to price your home
                  right from day one. I analyze comparable sales, market trends,
                  buyer psychology, and competitive positioning. I price
                  strategically to attract qualified buyers while maximizing
                  your sale price.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">
                  Step 3: Aggressive Marketing Launch
                </h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Week 1-2 is maximum exposure. Strategic open house with buyer
                  pre-qualification. Network activation reaching 500+ agents.
                  Targeted Facebook and Google ads. Email marketing to qualified
                  buyers. Daily follow-up on all showings. This aggressive
                  marketing creates momentum and generates offers.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">
                  Step 4: Active Negotiation
                </h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Week 2-3 is when offers come in and negotiations begin. I use
                  aggressive follow-up, buyer psychology tactics, and strategic
                  counter-offers to get you top dollar. I don't accept lowball
                  offers. I negotiate them up. This aggressive negotiation is
                  how I get 98.7% of asking price average.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mb-4 mt-8">
                  Step 5: Closing Management
                </h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Week 3-4 is closing. Escrow management, timeline enforcement,
                  problem resolution, final walkthrough coordination. I manage
                  every detail through closing. This complete management ensures
                  your sale closes smoothly and on time.
